This paper shows that rental market interactions allow these small firms to increase their effective scale and mechanize production. We conduct a survey of manufacturing firms in Uganda, which uncovers an active rental market for large machines between small firms in informal clusters. We then build an equilibrium model of firm behavior and estimate it with our data. We find that the rental market is quantitatively important for mechanization and productivity since it provides a workaround for other market imperfections that keep firms small. The rental market also shapes the effectiveness of development policies to foster mechanization, such as subsidies to purchase machines. Overall, our results point to the importance of taking into account firm‐to‐firm interactions within informal clusters to understand technology adoption in low income countries - focusing on the small scale of firms in isolation might be misleading.","tags":["Papers"],"title":"Achieving Scale Collectively","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ritwika Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"040d8730d5dd3a4434f3928b116949dd","permalink":"https://ritwikasen.github.io/publication/localcontent/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/localcontent/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter analyses policy options to promote local content in Uganda as it transitions to an oil-producing country. It contends that productive linkages between oil and gas exporters and domestic suppliers in a range of ‘connected’ goods and services sectors can be a source of broad-based economic growth. However, the success of policy initiatives or extensive regulatory requirements will ultimately hinge on domestic firm capabilities to overcome barriers to entry into the global industry. The analysis comprises an evaluation of existing local content policies in Uganda, a mapping of the natural resource value chain, and an assessment of domestic firm capabilities to supply the anticipated demand for goods and services from the oil and gas industry.","tags":["Other"],"title":"Enhancing Local Content in Uganda","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maitreesh Ghatak","Ritwika Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"ddeba8c76eb7941d32c614649142d02b","permalink":"https://ritwikasen.github.io/publication/subsidy/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/subsidy/","section":"publication","summary":"The Political Economy and Development of India (PEDI) proposes what is now a very well-known hypothesis about the reasons for the low-growth regime that India experienced from the 60s to the early 80s - interest-group politics in a democracy leads to populism and subsidies, choking off resources for accumulation through public investment in infrastructure. This political economy of constraints, according to Bardhan, seems to have blocked the economy’s escape from a low-level equilibrium trap of low growth. This chapter looks at a part of Bardhan’s argument, namely the relationship between subsidies and growth. The chapter studies the patterns of growth in income per capita and subsidies over the period 1980–81 to 2013–14 and finds, contrary to PEDI, that both economic growth and subsidies increased. Put together, these trends do not provide evidence in favour of the ‘Bardhan subsidy hypothesis’ that the subsidy Raj was the most important binding constraint to economic growth in the 1980s.","tags":["Other"],"title":"Growth and the Subsidy Raj in India - Re-examining the Bardhan Hypothesis","type":"publication"}]
